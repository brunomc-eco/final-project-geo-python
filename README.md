# Seasonal Weather Anomalies at Sodankylä, Finland

This is the final project for the course Geo-Python 2021.

Geo-Python is organized by the Department of Geosciences and Geography at the University of Helsinki.
More info [here](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/).

The final exercise in the Geo-Python course involves calculating and plotting seasonal weather anomalies to see how temperatures have changed in different seasons over the past 100+ years. The weather data used is from the Sodankylä weather station in northern Finland.

General instructions and raw data were provided to by the course instructors, but the full Jupyter notebook and Python code was written by [Bruno M. Carvalho](mailto:brunomc.eco@gmail.com).
